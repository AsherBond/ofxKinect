- - -- How to download ofxKinect

To use ofxKinect, first you need to download and install Open Frameworks. ofxKinect-beta.xcodeproj is developed against the latest version of Open Frameworks on github, while ofxKinect.xcodeproj will work against older releases like r62.

To get a copy of the repository you can download the source from http://github.com/ofTheo/ofxKinect/zipball/master or, alternatively, you can use git clone. The addon should sit in openFrameworks/addons/ofxKinect/.

- - -- How to run ofxKinect

If you're using OS X, open the XCode project in ofxKinect/example/ and hit "Build and Run". You might want to chose "Release" instead of "Debug".

If you're using Linux, you should open the Code::Blocks .cbp and hit F9 to build and run.
You should create some udev rules in order to run the app without root privileges:
As root write this to /etc/udev/rules.d/51-kinect.rules (this works on Ubuntu 10.10):
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="045e", SYSFS{idProduct}=="02ae", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="045e", SYSFS{idProduct}=="02ad", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="045e", SYSFS{idProduct}=="02b0", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"

- - -- Make a project using ofxKinect

To develop your own project based on ofxKinect, simply copy the example project and rename it. You probably want to put it in your apps folder, for example, after copying:

openFrameworks/addons/ofxKinect/example/ => openFrameworks/apps/myApps/example/

Then after renaming:

openFrameworks/apps/myApps/myKinectProject/

- - -- Adding ofxKinect to an existing project

If you want to add ofxKinect to another project, you need to make sure you include the src and libs folders:

openFrameworks/addons/ofxKinect/src
openFrameworks/addons/ofxKinect/libs

If you drag in the entire ofxKinect/ folder to XCode, make sure you delete the example/ folder and any other extra files you don't need. Once you've included these files, you also need to add a header search path to your project. In XCode, right click on your project, click "Get Info", in the spotlight type "header", and then select "Header Search Paths". Click the "+" button at the bottom left and add the path "../../../addons/ofxKinect/libs/libusb". Make sure to check the "recursive" box. Then click "Ok" and close the info window.
